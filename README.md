### Basic description: 

* In artificial_data.ipynb, we generate 4 different types of seasonality, then describe each one of them to understand how these seasonal patterns behave.

* In descriptive-data.ipynb, we use the ydata_profiling package to quickly generate a profile report.

* In Cross-correlation, we use the Cross Correlation Function (CCF) to examine the correlation between each variable and the target variable at lag 0 and to assess the correlation at further lags.
